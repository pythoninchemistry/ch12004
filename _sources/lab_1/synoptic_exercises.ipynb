This is perfectly valid Python, but the name `print` was **already in use**: it is the name of the `print` function. This means that when the final line runs, Python complains that you are treating a `str` (a string) like a **function**, as we have effectively replaced the `print` function with the string: 'This code calculates the solutions to 5x^2 + 12x + 7'.\n",

    "So if we have seem to have \"lost\" the print function, how do we get it back? We can do this by **restarting the kernel**. In your Jupyter notebook, navigate via the menu bar at the top to Kernel->Restart and Run All Cells. This will effectively clear Python's memory and re-run all of your code, meaning that `print` will once again refer to the **function** we want. Be sure to fix code block 4 before you do this (i.e. actually **call** the print function rather than assigning a variable to that name).\n",
