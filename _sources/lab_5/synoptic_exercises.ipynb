    "It's time to **plot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** You have been provided with an experimental pressure/volume isotherm for $\\ce{SF6}$ at $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ in the form of a [csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pythoninchemistry/ch12004/main/CH12004/lab_5/isotherm.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Read in the experimental data using `numpy`, convert to SI units and plot the isotherm using `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Assuming ideality, the isotherm should be well modelled by the ideal gas law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{RT}{v},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the pressure, $v$ is the molar volume ($V / n$), $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to calculate the pressure with the ideal gas law and use this to model the $\\ce{SF6}$ isotherm between $v = 6.87 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ and $v = 4.47 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. Plot your modelled isotherm against the experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Non-ideality due to intermolecular interactions and other factors can be accounted for (in part) by the Van der Waals equation of state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{RT}{v - b} - \\frac{a}{v^{2}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the pressure, $R$ is the gas constant, $v$ is the molar volume and $a$ and $b$ are system dependent constants that describe the strength of the interactions and excluded volume effects respectively.\n",

Plot your modelled isotherm and compare this against the idealised curve and the experimental data.\n",

    "**2.** The **mean activity** of ions in solution can be measured experimentally. You have been provided with the mean activity of $\\ce{Na2SO4}$ at $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ for a range of ionic strengths: [activity.dat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pythoninchemistry/ch12004/main/CH12004/lab_5/activity.dat)\n",

Using $A = 1.179\\,$M$^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, plot the Debye-Huckel mean activity from $I = 0\\,$M to $I = 6\\,$M and compare this with the experimental values.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) There are several extensions of the Debye-Huckel limiting law that aim to improve its description of the mean activity outside of the dilute limit. One such extension is:\n",

    "Write a function to calculate the mean activity according to the extended Debye-Huckel limiting law. Using $B = 18.3$ and $a_{0} = 0.071$, plot the extended Debye-Huckel mean activity from $I = 0\\,$M to $I = 6\\,$M and compare this with the experimental values and the original Debye-Huckel limiting law."
