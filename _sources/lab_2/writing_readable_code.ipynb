    "We have now covered enough Python for us to talk a little bit about **readability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have not really been concerned with writing \"good\" code, or really with judging the \"quality\" of our code at all. We have just been learning bits and bobs of Python and trying to write code that does what we would like it to do. Of course, what constitutes \"good\" code is highly subjective, one person's \"good\" code is another's \"absolute disaster\", so we would probably be better off talking about more objective metrics. In programming discourse you will often hear about **readable code**, which is a slightly more clear-cut descriptor. If your code is **readable**, it should be possible for someone else to have a quick scan through it and get a rough idea of what it is supposed to do and why it is written in the way that it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth us pausing for a moment to consider a few reasons **why** we should care about making our code **readable**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is much easier to share code with other people if you don't need to spend hours on end explaining what it does and how to use it.\n",
    "    - This is true not only for other people, but also for your **future self**! It is quite incredible how quickly you can forget why you wrote your code from a few weeks ago the way that you did. Making your code as **readable** as possible mitigates this problem and ensures that you can pick up where you left off much more quickly.\n",
    "- Making your code more **readable** often makes it easier to spot **bugs**. Simple things like poorly named variables are often the cause of very difficult to find problems.\n",
    "    - This is also important if you are asking other people for help with your code. If they can understand what you have written relatively quickly, then they are much more likely to be able to offer meaningful advice rather than having to stare at your monitor for a good half an hour.\n",
    " \n",
    "As mentioned above, readability is definitely not objective, but nonetheless there are at least a couple of simple things you can do that most people would agree are a good idea."
