# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I download my code?

Yes, look [here](./noteable_interface.md#Downloading-notebooks) for instructions.

## Can more than one person work on a notebook at once?

Unfortunately, Noteable does not support this. Instead, collaborative work must be done in separate notebooks and combined manually.

## How can I add equations to my notebook?

Use a markdown cell with LaTeX formatting - see [here](./noteable_interface.md#Markdown-cells) for how to use markdown cells, and [here](https://www.upyesp.org/posts/makrdown-vscode-math-notation/) for how to write equations with LaTeX formatting.
