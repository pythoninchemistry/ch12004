    "**1.** There are several infinite series that converge to something proportional to $\\pi$. For example, the Basel series is defined as an infinite sum of reciprocal square numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{1^{2}} + \\frac{1}{2^{2}} + \\frac{1}{3^{2}} + \\cdots = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} = \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Write a function to approximate $\\pi$ by evaluating the Basel series up to a given term $n$. Test your function for $n = 1000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Another infinite series that converges to something proportional to $\\pi$ is the Leibniz formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{9} - \\cdots = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k + 1} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}.$$\n",

    "Write a function to approximate $\\pi$ by evaluating the Leibniz formula up to a given term $n$. Test your function for $n = 1000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The accuracy of an approximate value of $\\pi$ is simply measured by calculating the absolute difference from the exact value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\pi - \\pi_{\\mathrm{approx}}|.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to evaluate the above expression and use this to determine which of your previous functions is more accurate when evaluated up to the $50$th term.\n",

    "You can access the exact value of $\\pi$ (up to a finite number of decimal places) via `math.pi`.\n",

    "**2.** The distance between two points $i$ and $j$ in two-dimensional space can be calculated with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d(i, j) = \\sqrt{(x_{i} - x_{j})^{2} + (y_{i} - y_{j})^{2}},$$\n",

    "                   [-1.13, -0.65]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **nested list** (a list of lists), where each **sublist** contains the coordinates associated with one atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using [loops](../lab_3/loops.ipynb), calculate and `print` the distances between **all pairs of atoms** in BF$_{3}$. Use the function you wrote in a) to calculate each distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "You will need a **nested loop** to generate all possible pairs of atoms.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Rather than using the `print` function to display all of your calculated distances, modify the code you wrote for b) so that the distances are instead used to build a **distance matrix**:\n",
