    "Before we dive headfirst into the fundamentals of programming in Python, let's take a whistle-stop tour of **running code** in a **Jupyter notebook**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, open up a new Jupyter notebook via **Noteable**, as described previously in [lab 0](../lab_0/using_noteable.ipynb). You should be greeted with something like:\n",

    "In general it is good practice to give your notebooks a somewhat more descriptive title than \"Untitled\", so feel free to **rename** your new notebook at this stage by clicking on \"Untitled\" and supplying a new name:\n",
    "\n",
    "![rename_notebook](images/rename_notebook.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are made up of **cells**; in your new notebook, there will only be **one** cell at first: the grey box with `In [ ]` to the left of it. We can start writing some code in a cell by clicking inside of it so that the **blue border** on the left turns **green**:\n",

    "Here our code is pretty easy to interpret even if you've never learnt any Python before: `2+2`. At the moment, we have **written** this code, but we have not **run** it, so the calculation has not actually been performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **run** a cell in your Jupyter notebook, make sure it is currently selected (it should have the **green border** to the left) and press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>:\n",

    "![run_cell](images/run_cell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure enough we now have an **output**, here the result of our simple calculation of `2+2`. Notice the numbers in square brackets to the left of the cell itself: `In [1]` and `Out[1]`. These represent the **order** in which our cells have been **run**. We can see this by running some more code (notice that Jupyter has added a **new cell** beneath the first one):\n",
    "\n",
    "![second_cell](images/second_cell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To reproduce the above, just type out the code in the second cell `5-2` and press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> again. You should see that the second cell has `In [2]` and `Out[2]` to the left of it, indicating that this cell was run **after** the previous one. If we select the **first** cell again and run it for a **second time**:\n",
