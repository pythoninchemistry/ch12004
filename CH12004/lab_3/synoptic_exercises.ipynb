    "**1.** Write a program to play \"[Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)\". Your code should loop over numbers between $1$ and $100$, printing `'Fizz'` for those that are divisible by $3$, `'Buzz'` for those divisible by $5$ and `'Fizz Buzz'` for those divisible by both $3$ and $5$.\n",
